## Conventions for this project

Anything client-specific worth noting here. Examples:

- Breakpoints used in design: 320, 704, 1024, 1440, 1920, 2560 (Tailwind names min/sm/md/lg/xl/max)
- Icon system: [e.g., Lucide, custom SVGs in `src/components/icons/`]
- Text styles use `role/step-weight` (e.g. `heading/9xl-275`, `ui/base-400`). Font sizes use `text/[step]` on a fluid Utopia scale.
- Any gotchas specific to this file (e.g., "the old hero variant in the archive page is deprecated — don't use it as reference")

## Figma ↔ code mapping

A quick reference for where Figma components live in code. This is not a substitute for Code Connect mappings — those are the source of truth — but it's useful for human navigation.

| Figma component | Code location |
|---|---|
| Button | `src/components/Button.tsx` |
| Card | `src/components/Card.tsx` |
| NavBar | `src/components/NavBar.tsx` |

## Notes

- Don't commit `.fig` exports to the repo. Figma files are not versioned files in the Git sense — Figma's own version history is the source of truth for design changes.
- If a Figma file is archived or deprecated, move it under a "Deprecated" heading below rather than deleting the entry. Someone will eventually ask "what happened to the old homepage file."
